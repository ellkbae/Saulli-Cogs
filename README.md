## What is this abomination?

Cogs for Red Discordbot in the /d/Gaming server. Most of these are focused on the Bel Bot.

## If you'd like to just drop in to play games with no help.

Feel free to not ask for help with these in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/gaming)

If you'd like to see additional features or find a bug, don't leave an issue
most likely I have no idea what I am doing.
